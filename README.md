# ModScript
### Modular Scripting

> This plugin borrows a lot of code from https://github.com/VCVRack/VCV-Prototype/tree/v2  
> File watching and all engines except LuaJIT have been removed  
> The Midi to CV module is copied from VCV Rack's Core plugin https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack/blob/v2/src/core/MIDI_CV.cpp  
> Where appropriate, any other reference to orignal code is included.  
> The repository linked above contain additional licensing information in LICENSE.md at their root.  

:warning: Heavily WIP!
